export const about = `
  hibearnation is a web app that aims to provide a comprehensive (unofficial)
  information hub for Brown University's residence halls. We hope to 
  provide a platform for students to share their experiences and 
  knowledge about Brown's residence halls through the form of
  **user-generated reviews and photos**. During housing selections season,
  we also provide a **spreadsheet of room availability with summary
  statistics** for each hall. We hope that this information will help
  students make informed decisions about their housing options.
